This repository is an example to showcase [this issue](https://github.com/supasate/connected-react-router/issues/205) in `connected-react-router`.

## Instructions

cd connected-react-router-poc

yarn install
```

Inside of `src/index.js` you can comment/uncomment two different "versions" of the application. One uses the `ConnectedRouter` component from `connected-react-router`, and one doesn't. There are various `console.log` statements in components to show when they're being re-rendered.
